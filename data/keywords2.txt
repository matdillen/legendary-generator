<p><em>The HYDRA Super-Adaptoid and the HYDRA High Council constantly adapt their tactics to attack the Heroes in new ways. Accordingly, each of these Masterminds is a new “Adapting Mastermind” with 4 different Master Strikes. Here’s how they work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A Normal Mastermind has a Mastermind card and 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. An Adapting Mastermind instead has just 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. Whichever Tactic is currently on top of the stack of Tactics counts as the current Mastermind card.</li>
<li>Say you are using Hydra Super-Adaptoid as your Mastermind. Keep all his tactics in a face up stack. Use only the rules on that top card, ignoring the rest of the cards in the stack.</li>
<li>Whenever an Adapting Mastermind does a Master Strike, it says “<strong>Adapt”</strong> at the end. This means “<strong>Shuffle the Mastermind Tactics and randomly put one on top, face up.”</strong> You might randomly pick the same Tactic that was previously on top, or it might be a different Tactic.</li>
<li>Likewise, when you fight an Adapting Mastermind, you always fight the Tactic currently on top of the stack. You ignore all the card abilities and <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> bonuses that are not currently on top of the stack. The “Fight” ability also says “Adapt” at the end. So you put the Tactic you just fought into your Victory Pile, do its Fight effect, then shuffle the remaining Tactics and randomly put one on top, face up.</li>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Example 1</strong>: Say you have a Hero that gives [<strong>1 Recruit</strong>] and says “Draw a card. Cheering Crowds.” As you play this Hero, you could return a Bystander to play the Hero twice in a row, getting [<strong>2 Recruit</strong>] and drawing two cards.</em></p>

<li>Essentially you play the card itself, and then you play a bonus copy of that card.</li>

The first play wouldn’t get the “[<strong>Instinct</strong>]: Draw a card ” ability, since you haven’t played an [<strong>Instinct</strong>] card earlier in the turn.

<li>If you had played a different [<strong>Instinct</strong>] card before doubling the Cheering Crowds card, then you would get to use “[<strong>Instinct</strong>]: Draw a card” ability both times, getting [<strong>4 Attack</strong>] and drawing two cards.</li>

<p><em>This keyword represents how Morgan le Fay and the knights of her “Queen’s Vengeance” hail from a realm of honorable single combat. You can’t gang up on an enemy in a Chivalrous Duel – you have to pick just one Hero Name to duel the enemy. </em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To fight an enemy with “Chivalrous Duel,” you can only use <img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""> from a single Hero Name.</strong></li>
<li>For example, to fight a 3 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong>  Villain with Chivalrous Duel, you can spend 3 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> from two different Black Knight hero cards.

<li>If a Hero like “S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper” doesn’t have a Hero Name listed, then its Hero Name is the same as its card name. So you can play three S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers then fight a 3 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> Villain with Chivalrous Duel.

<li>Playing a fourth <strong><img src=""silver.png""></strong> card wouldn’t reduce this cost any further since there are only three <strong><img src=""silver.png""></strong> icons listed in this particular Microscopic Size- Changing ability.</li>
<li>The second twist is that Microscopic Size- Changing can actually <strong>reduce a card’s <img src=""Recruit.jpg"" width=""16""> cost to zero or even a negative number!</strong> When you recruit a Microscopic Size-Changing Hero with a negative cost, <strong>you actually gain that many <img src=""Recruit.jpg"" width=""16""> points!</strong></li>
<li>Some Villains also have Microscopic Size- Changing. It works the same way, letting you fight that Villain for 2 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> less for each card of the correct color you played this turn, counting up to the number of icons shown in the Microscopic Size-Changing ability.</li>
<li>Likewise, if you fight a Villain with Microscopic Size-Changing and reduce its <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> value to a negative number, you actually gain that many <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> points when you fight it. You don’t even need to have any <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> points before you fight them.</li>
<li>For example, say you play five <strong><img src=""red.png""></strong> Heroes, then fight a Villain with 3 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> and “Microscopic Size- Changing <strong><img src=""red.png""> <img src=""red.png""> <img src=""red.png""> <img src=""red.png""></strong> .” The Villain’s <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> decreases to -5, and you actually gain 5 <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> when you fight them! (The 5th <strong><img src=""red.png""></strong> Hero you played didn’t reduce the <strong><img src=""Attack.jpg"" width=""16""></strong> , since the Microscopic Size- Changing ability only had 4 icons.)</li>

<li>In a game with many Moonlight and Sunlight effects, some players like to shift<br />
the odd-numbered cost cards in the HQ down a little bit, as shown below. This<br />
makes it easier to tell at a glance whether Moonlight or Sunlight is in effect.</p>
<h4><em><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><span style=""color:#333333;text-decoration:underline;"">Moonlight and Sunlight Timing</span></span></em></h4>
<p><em>As always, do a card’s abilities in the order they are listed. You check Moonlight or Sunlight at the moment when you would use that ability.</p>
<p></em></li>
<li>For example, Sunspot has a card that says<br />
<strong>Moonlight:</strong> You may put a Hero from the HQ on the bottom of the Hero Deck.<br />
<strong>Sunlight:</strong> Draw a card.<br />
Sunspot’s cards primarily benefit from Sunlight, so the Moonlight ability here mostly helps him push the HQ towards Sunlight.</li>
<li>You do these abilities in the order they are listed. So if there are three odd-numbered cards in the HQ, and you play this card, you might be able to use the Moonlight ability to change the HQ to have only two odd-numbered cards, and then you could immediately use the Sunlight ability.</li>
<li>Once you are completely done playing a Hero card or fighting a Villain with a Moonlight or Sunlight ability, move on. If later in the turn you change Moonlight or<br />
Sunlight, you don’t go back in time to change the past.</p>
<h4><span style=""text-decoration:underline;color:#333333;""><em>Remembering Odd and Even</em></span></h4>

<li>When Villains escape, KO’ing Heroes in the HQ, you can also use this opportunity to shift towards Moonlight or Sunlight.</li>
<li>In a game with many Moonlight and Sunlight effects, some players like to shift<br />
the odd-numbered cost cards in the HQ down a little bit, as shown below. This<br />
makes it easier to tell at a glance whether Moonlight or Sunlight is in effect.</p>
<h4><em><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><span style=""color:#333333;text-decoration:underline;"">Moonlight and Sunlight Timing</span></span></em></h4>
<p><em>As always, do a card’s abilities in the order they are listed. You check Moonlight or Sunlight at the moment when you would use that ability.</p>
<p></em></li>
<li>For example, Sunspot has a card that says<br />
<strong>Moonlight:</strong> You may put a Hero from the HQ on the bottom of the Hero Deck.<br />
<strong>Sunlight:</strong> Draw a card.<br />
Sunspot’s cards primarily benefit from Sunlight, so the Moonlight ability here mostly helps him push the HQ towards Sunlight.</li>
<li>You do these abilities in the order they are listed. So if there are three odd-numbered cards in the HQ, and you play this card, you might be able to use the Moonlight ability to change the HQ to have only two odd-numbered cards, and then you could immediately use the Sunlight ability.</li>
<li>Once you are completely done playing a Hero card or fighting a Villain with a Moonlight or Sunlight ability, move on. If later in the turn you change Moonlight or<br />
Sunlight, you don’t go back in time to change the past.</p>

<p><em>As a new twist on the Artifacts of past sets, Legendary@: Heroes of Asgard introduces an<br />
all-new card type: “Villainous Weapons.” Villains and Masterminds can capture these ancient weapons to become even more powerful. But if you defeat them, you can seize those weapons to use as Artifacts of your own.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Villainous Weapons are not Villains.</li>
<li>When a Villainous Weapon is played from the Villain Beck, <strong>the Weapon is captured by the Villain in the city that’s closest to the Villain Deck. If there are no Villains in the city, then KO the Weapon instead</strong>.</li>
<li>Villainous Weapons empower the Villain holding them, adding the [<strong>Attack</strong>] bonus printed on the Weapon. Tuck the Weapon under the Villain so you can see the Weapon’s [<strong>Attack</strong>] bonus right under the Villain’s [<strong>Attack</strong>].</li>
<li>An enemy can use any number of Weapons at the same time, getting all of their bonuses combined.</li>
<li><strong>When a Villain with any number of Villainous Weapons escapes the city, the Mastermind captures all those Weapons</strong>, getting their [<strong>Attack</strong>] bonuses.</li>
<li>When you fight a Villain or Mastermind holding any number of Weapons, <strong>put all those Weapons into your discard pile as Artifacts</strong>.</li>
<li>When you have a Villainous Weapon in your hand, you can play it just like any other Artifact.</li>
<li><strong>You never get the Weapon’s printed</strong> [<strong>Attack</strong>]<strong> bonus</strong> when you play the Artifact or control it. Only Villains and Masterminds get that [<strong style=""color:var(--color-text);"">Attack</strong><span style=""color:var(--color-text);"">]</span><span style=""color:var(--color-text);""> bonus. You only get the specific Artifact abilities written on the card.</span></li>
<li>Villainous Weapons you have captured as Artifacts <strong>have 0 cost</strong>, have no color or Hero Class, and don’t count as Hero cards or Villain cards. Since they have no cost, Villainous Weapons can never make you Worthy. (How appropriate… )</li>
<li>If you have gained a Villainous Weapon, and a card effect makes an enemy capture that Weapon again, then it works as a Villainous Weapon again until someone defeats that enemy to reclaim it.</li>
<li>Malekith and Hela both have Mastermind Tactics that turn into Villainous Weapons. You win when the Mastermind has no face down Tactics left under them, even if there are still some Tactics that have turned into other card types somewhere.</li>
