'''Ambush''': Put this into your discard pile. If this is in your hand at the start of your turn, the player on your left gains this card and the player on your right gains a Wound.

'''Tyrant Mastermind'''
The Mastermind has +3 Attack.
== '''Keywords''' ==

=== Dark City ===

'''Teleport''': Instead of playing, you may set aside a card with the keyword "'''Teleport'''". If you do, add it to your new hand at the end of your turn as an extra card.

'''Bribe''': You can fight villains with the keyword "'''Bribe'''" by spending any combination of Attack and/or Recruit points. For example, you may play two S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and two S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers to fight the +4 Attack Maggia Goons."

'''Versatile''': When you play a card with the keyword "'''Versatile'''" you must first choose between Recruit and Fight. Once you have chosen, the card provides recruit or fight equal to the '''Versatile''' value. For example, '''Versatile 3''' gives you +3 Recruit or +3 Attack.

=== Fantastic Four ===

'''Focus''': The new "'''Focus'''" keyword lets you transform your Recruit Points into powerful, flexible effects. It looks like this:
"'''Focus''' Recruit '''->''' [EFFECT]"
When you play a card with a '''Focus''' ability, you can pay the cost on the left side of the arrow to get the effect on right side of the arrow. You can use that '''Focus''' ability as many times as you want for the rest of the turn. For example, say you play a card that says:
"'''Focus 2''' Recruit '''->''' Draw a card."
For the rest of your turn, you can use 2 Recruit Points to draw a card, as many times as you want, as long as you have the Recruit points avaiable. You can even play more Heroes, recruit, fight, then use the Focus ability more.
* '''Note''': You can use '''Focus''' abilities and still use the "Healing" ability on Wounds.

'''Burrow''': '''Subterranea''' Villains use the new '''Burrow''' keyword. This allows them to retreat by digging to safety when they are attacked. "'''Burrow'''" means:
"'''Fight''': If the Streets were empty, put this Villain back into the Streets."
When you fight a Villain with '''Burrow''', do all of that Villain's '''Fight''' effects. You rescue any Bystanders the Villain may have captured as normal. Then, if the "Streets" city space was empty, put that Villain back into the Streets space. This means that to stop a Villain with '''Burrow''' permanently, you have to:
* Fight it while it's in the Streets, or
* Fight it while another Villain occupies the Streets, or
* Fight it once to drive it back to the Streets then fight it again in the Streets to finish it.
If you fight a Villain with '''Burrow''' twice in a turn, you'll do that Villain's "'''Fight'''" effects twice. Cards that do something "when you defeat" a Villain still work if the Villain burrows to the Streets. When a Villain burrows to the Streets, it does not do any Ambush effects

'''Cosmic Threat''': Galactus and his Heralds use the new '''Cosmic Threat''' keyword. This gives them incredibly high Attack values with a special vulnerability. If an enemy has '''Cosmic Threat''': https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png that means: "Once per turn, for each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png card you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack this turn."
For example, Morg has '''Cosmic Threat''': https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png and 12* Attack.
* If you reveal two https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png cards, Morg gets -6 Attack this turn, so he has 6 Attack left.
* If you reveal four or more https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png cards, Morg gets -12 Attack this turn, so he has 0 Attack, and you can fight him without spending any Attack.
(An asterisk next to an Enemy's Attack number is to remind you that their Attack can change. The asterisk doesn't mean anything else.)

'''Galactus' Cosmic Threat''': Galactus has the "'''Cosmic Threat''': https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png ability. This means:
"Once per turn, choose https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png. For each card of that color you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack for one fight this turn."
If you try to fight Galactus a second time in the same turn, he will return to his full Attack and you cannot use his '''Cosmic Threat''' ability a second time that turn.

=== Paint the Town Red ===

'''Wall-Crawl''': The new "'''Wall-Crawl'''" keyword lets Heroes set up powerful combos by placing cards at the top of their decks. "'''Wall-Crawl'''" means:
"'''When you recruit this Hero, you may put it on top of your deck.'''"
With Wall-Crawl, you get to use your new Hero much faster than you would if that Hero went in your discard pile. Keep an eye out for powerful combos you can create if you recruit a Wall-Crawl Hero early in your turn, before you play cards that reveal the top card of your deck.
* Remember: When you use Wall-Crawl to put a card on top of your deck, don't use any other abilities on that card until it gets drawn from your deck. If you "gain" a Hero through some special ability like Skrull Shapeshifters, you can't use Wall-Crawl because you didn't "recruit" that Hero.

'''Feast''': The new Mastermind Carnage and his "Maximum Carnage" followers use the gruesome new Feast keyword. "'''Feast'''" states that when you fight a Villain or Mastermind with this ability you treat it as a fight effect. IE:
"'''Feast" = "Fight: KO the top card of your deck.'''"
Some Maximum Carnage Villains create special effects when they feast on certain cards
* Carnage's Master Strike starts with "Feast on each player." That means each player does the "'''Feast'''" effect. Then Carnage's Master Strike causes Wounds when he feasts on certain cards.
* Note that Carnage's Master Strike is the only effect that feasts on every player. The "Maximum Carnage" Villains and Carnage's Mastermind Tactics each feast on only one player.
* While Carnage's Master Strike causes Wounds, the Feast abilities on his Mastermind Tactics and most of his Villains don't cause Wounds.

=== Villains ===

'''Demolish''': "Demolish each player" means "Reveal the top card of the Ally (Hero) Deck, note its cost, and put it on the bottom of the Ally Deck. Each player reveals their hand and discards a card with that cost."

'''Dodge''': "Dodge" means "During your turn, you may discard this card from your hand to draw another card." Many Dodge cards have conditional effects so that sometimes you want to play them, and sometimes you want to Dodge them away. Dodge also helps you sculpt your hand towards Recruit Points or Attack as you desire.
* When you Dodge a card from your hand, ignore all the other text on that card.
* When you Dodge a card from your hand, you didn't "play" that card, so the Dodged card's Ally (Hero) Class/color doesn't help you use the Superpower abilities of other cards you play that turn.
* Some Allies in the Villains set count the number of cards you discarded this turn. This includes cards you discarded with Dodge.

'''Elusive''': "Elusive 6" means "You can only fight this Adversary if you have made at least 6 Recruit this turn." You don't have to spend that Recruit to fight this Adversary, you just have to have made that much Recruit this turn. You can still spend that Recruit on recruiting Allies (Heroes).

'''X-Treme Attack''': "X-Treme" means "This Adversary gets +1 Attack for each other Adversary in the city with X-Treme Attack."

=== Guardians of the Galaxy ===

'''Shards''': This set contains 18 "Shard" tokens. These tokens can be gained by players, Villains and Masterminds from the supply. <strike>If a Shard would be gained, but there are none left in the supply, then no Shard is gained, and the game continues.</strike> (Rule superseded by Into the Cosmos.)
* '''Players''': When you gain a Shard, put it in front of you. You can spend a Shard to get '''+1''' Attack (returning the Shard to the supply). If you don't use a Shard immediately, you can keep it for future turns and use it later. You can spend as many as you wish in a single turn. Shards do not have Victory Points.
* '''Villains''': When a Villain gains Shards, put them on that Villain from the supply. That Villain gets '''+1''' Attack for each Shard it has. After you defeat a Villain, you take one of its Shards. Return the rest to the supply. When a Villain escapes, the Mastermind gains one of the Shards on that Villain. Return the rest to the supply.
* '''Mastermind''': When a Mastermind gains Shards, put them on that Mastermind from the supply. That Mastermind gets '''+1''' Attack for each Shard it has. After you fight a Mastermind, you take one of its Shards. Return the rest to the supply. Then do the Fight effect on the Mastermind Tactic, which might give the Mastermind additional Shards for future fights.

'''Artifact''': This set also contains powerful new "Artifacts" cards that players can use for permanent advantages. Some Hero cards are also Artifacts. (They still count as Hero cards too.) When you gain a Hero Artifact, put it in your discard pile like any other Hero card. When you draw that Artifact later in the game, you may play it in front of you and use its effects, usually once on each of your turns. This means you "control" that Artifact. At the end of your turn, when you discard all the cards you played that turn, the Artifacts you control stay in.
* You can use an Artifact on the first turn you play it.
* You can control multiple Artifacts with the same card name and use each of them.
* You can't use your Artifacts' "once per turn" abilities during other players' turns.
* If a card effect during any player's turn asks you to "Reveal a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png Hero," you may reveal a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png Hero Artifact you control. Card effects that say "your Heroes" or "Heroes you have" include Hero Artifacts you control as well.
* However, you only "played" an Artifact on the turn you put it out, so it only activates Superpower Abilities (like "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png: You get +1 Attacks") on the turn you play the Artifact, not every turn of the game. Likewise, card effects that count "each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png Hero you played this turn" only count an Artifact if you played it this turn.
* You don't have to use an Artifact's abilities on a turn if you don't want to.
* If you are using Final Showdown, you can use Artifacts during your Showdown Turn.
* If a card effect like Rogue, Chameleon, or Star-Lord would let you "copy" an Artifact card, then you can use that Artifact's "Once per turn" ability once, and there is no other effect.

'''Thrown Artifact''': Some Ally cards in this set are "Thrown Artifacts". These are Artifact cards that the player can "throw" at the perfect moment.
* To "throw" a Thrown Artifact, put it on the bottom of your deck and use its ability.
* You can throw as many Artifacts as you want in a turn. You can only throw during your turn.
* If a card effect like Rogue, Chameleon, or Star-Lord would let you "copy" a Thrown Artifact card, use that Artifact's "When you throw this" ability once, and there is no other effect. (Don't put anything on the bottom of your deck.)

'''Uru-Enchanted Weapons''': When you try to fight an enemy that has some number of Uru-Enchanted Weapons, reveal that many cards from the top of the Adversary Deck. That enemy immediately gains +Attack equal to the total Victory Points of all the cards you revealed. If you have enough Attack points to match the enemy's improved Attack, use them and defeat the enemy as normal. If you don't have enough Attack points, you don't defeat this enemy, you lose all your Attack points, and you can't fight anymore this turn.
* Whether you defeat that enemy or not, put all the cards you revealed from the Adversary Deck on the bottom of that deck in random order.
* Many of these enemies have a "'''Fight or Fail''':" effect. Do this effect if you defeat them '''or''' if the Uru-Enchanted Weapons cause you to fail to defeat them.
* You can't try to fight an enemy unless you have enough Attack points to match its printed Attack.
* Once you start to fight an enemy, you can't play any more cards or throw any Artifacts until after that fight is complete. So remember to generate all the Attack points you can before you attack an enemy with Uru-Enchanted Weapons!
* The * symbol next to these Enemies' Attack indicates that they might get more Attack.
* Flipping cards for Uru-Enchanted Weapons cannot end the game. If you run out of cards in the Adversary Deck, shuffle the cards you've revealed so far and keep revealing. (If there are no cards left in the Adversary Deck there is no Attack bonus.)
* With 2-5 players, each flip tends to be worth about 1.5 attack. In solo mode: about 1 attack.

=== Secret Wars Volume 1 ===

'''Rise of the Living Dead''': "Each player checks the top card of their Victory Pile. If that card is a Villain with a 'Rise of the Living Dead' ability, that Villain reenters the city."
(Mastermind Tactics never return this way.)
If you put a Villain with Bystanders into your Victory Pile, you choose the order.

'''Cross-Dimensional Rampage''': "Cross-Dimensional (Character) Rampage" means "Each player reveals one of their (Character) Heroes or a (Character) card in their Victory pile or gains a Wound." (Character) cards include any card with "(Character)" in its card name or Hero name.
"Hulk" cards additionally include "Maestro" and "Nul, Breaker of Worlds."
"Wolverine" cards additionally include any card with "Weapon X" or "Old Man Logan".

=== Secret Wars Volume 2 ===

'''Spectrum''': Some cards have abilities like "Spectrum: Draw a card." You can use a card's Spectrum abilities only if you have at least 3 classes of Hero.
Grey S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes, HYDRA Allies, New Recruits and Sidekicks don't have classes, so they don't help.
You can count all the classes you have among cards you played this turn and cards in your hand.

'''Patrol''': Some cards have abilities like "Patrol the Sewers: If it's empty, rescue a Bystander." When you play that card, you can use that ability only if that city space has no cards in it.
If that city space becomes empty later in the turn, it's too late to use the Patrol ability.
This can also say "Fight: Patrol the Bank: If it's empty, you get +2 Recruit. If it's not, you get +2 Attack."
Other cards let you patrol even stranger places, like the Escape Pile or a Victory Pile. Similarly, you can use those Patrol abilities if that place has no cards in it.
If a Mastermind or Scheme causes a city space not to exist, you can't patrol that space.

'''Circle of Kung-Fu (and Quack-Fu)''': "5th Circle of Kung-Fu" means "During your turn, this Villain has +5 Attack unless you reveal a Hero that costs 5 or more."
Likewise, the 7th Circle gets +7 Attack unless you reveal a Hero that costs 7 or more, etc.
If a Villain or Mastermind already has a Circle of Kung-Fu, and a Scheme gives them another one, only count the highest circle - don't add them up.

'''Fateful Resurrection''': On a Villain card, "Fight: Fateful Resurrection" means "Fight: Reveal the top card of the Villain Deck. If it's a Scheme Twist or Master Strike, this Villain reenters the city."
If a Villain resurrects this way, you still rescue its Bystanders and do its other Fight effects.
The Villain pushes into the Sewers and does any Ambush abilities as normal.
If a Mastermind Tactic resurrects this way, shuffle it back into the other face down Tactics.
If a Villain that has ascended to become a Mastermind resurrects this way, it stays a Mastermind and does not reenter the city.

'''Charge''': "Ambush: Charge one space" means "(After this Villain enters the Sewers,) it charges forward an extra space, pushing other Villains forward."

=== Captain America 75th Anniversary ===

'''Man/Woman Out of Time''': "After you use this card's abilities, set it aside. At the beginning of your next turn, play this card a second time then discard it."
The card is discarded the second time you play it, so you play the card only twice total.
Play your returning Man Out of Time cards after the "Play a Villain Card" part of your turn and before you start playing out your hand.
You "played" a Man Out of Time card on both the first turn you played it and the second turn when you replayed it, so it can help activate your Superpower Abilities on both turns.

'''Savior''': "Use this ability if you have at least 3 Bystanders in your Victory Pile."
If you defeat a Villain with Bystanders, put those Bystanders into your Victory Pile before checking any Savior ability on that Villain.
If a Hero card rescues a Bystander, that Bystander counts towards any Savior ability on that Hero.

'''Abomination''': "This Villain gets +Attack equal to the printed Attack of the Hero in the HQ space under this Villain's city space."
"Ultimate Abomination" means "This Mastermind gets +Attack equal to the total printed Attack of all the Heroes in the HQ."
An Abomination Villain's Attack can go up and down as the Villain moves through the city.

=== Civil War ===

'''Divided''': Matching the theme of division and duality, Civil War introduces "Divided Cards," which have two miniature cards printed on the same card.
* You recruit a Divided Card from the HQ as normal by paying its cost. Each side of a Divided Card shows the same cost. (If it costs "3" on each side, you pay only 3 Recruit, not 6.)
* When you play a Divided Card, you choose which side to play. You generate all the Recruit, Attack, and special abilities of that side as normal. You ignore the other side, as if it doesn't exist.
* Each side of a Divided Card has a different Hero Class, like https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png. You can play the https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png side to get ready to use a Superpower Ability that triggers on https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png cards later in your turn.
* Different sides of Divided Cards often let you choose between Recruit, Attack, drawing cards, and other effects. Choose carefully which side to play!
* While a Divided Card is in your hand or the HQ, it counts as all its Hero Classes, Teams and Hero Names. But once you play it, the card only counts as the side you chose.
* When sorting and setting up, always use the Hero Name on the left side of a Divided Card.
* A Divided Card is one card, not two. So if you have to "discard two cards," "draw two cards," or count the number of cards in your hand, a Divided Card only counts as one card.

'''Size-Changing''' This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to massively change their size.
* Some Hero cards say, "Size-Changing: https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png." This means "You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less if you played a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png card this turn."
* Likewise, some Villain cards say, "Size-Changing: https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png." This means "You can fight this Villain for 2 Attack less if you played a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card this turn."
* Some Divided Cards say "Size-Changing: https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png" on one side and "Size-Changing: https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png" on the other side. You can recruit either side of the card with its own Size-Changing discount, but you can't get both discounts at once.

'''Phasing''': This keyword represents Heroes becoming insubstantial and moving through solid objects.
* During your turn, if a card with Phasing is in your hand, you may swap it with the top card of your deck.
* This lets you get a different card instead, save a crucial Phasing card for the next turn, or set up a combo that cares about the top card of your deck.
* Swapping cards this way isn't "playing a card" or "drawing a card," so it doesn't count for other abilities that trigger on those things.

'''Fortify''': This keyword represents Villains setting up nasty traps for the players.
* Some Villains say things like "Escape: Fortify the Mastermind. While it's fortified, the Mastermind can't be fought."
* Put this Villain on or near the specified place. While it's there, it has the listed effect. Any player can fight that Villain as normal to end that Fortify effect and put that Villain into their Victory Pile.
* If a card would fortify a place, don't do anything if there's already a Villain fortifying that place.

'''S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance''': This keyword represents pro-registration S.H.I.E.L.D. forces that can be only defeated with the help of S.H.I.E.L.D. information.
* If a Villain says "S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance," then you must discard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Hero as an additional cost to fight that Villain.
* Likewise, if a Mastermind has "Double S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance," then you must discard two S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes each time you fight them.
* If you are playing with HYDRA Heroes, you may discard them instead of S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes.

=== Deadpool ===

'''Excessive Violence''':
* Once per turn, you can spend one Attack point more than you need to fight a bad guy "using Excessive Violence." If you do, you get to use all the Excessive Violence abilities on Cards you've already played this turn.
* If you've played multiple Heroes (even multiple copies of the same Hero) with the Excessive Violence keyword they would all trigger at the same time. And no, you don't get to save it for later. Stop trying to find loopholes. It's annoying.
* If you fight with Excessive Violence, then draw or play more cards with Excessive Violence abilities later in the turn, it will be too late to use those abilities.
* Some bad guys also have Excessive Violence abilities that let you do something awesome. If you spend one more attack point than you need to fight them, you can do that awesome thing!

'''Revenge''':
* For Villain groups that have the Revenge ability, each Villain gets +1 Attack for every Villain of that group in your Victory Pile.
* Revenge is player specific. It will change based on the damage each player has caused to a Villain group. If you've KO'd 2 members of the Deadpool's 'Friends' Villain group then every other member of that group, that enters or is already in the city, will get +2 Attack during your turns. If another player has yet to KO'd a member of that group then the group doesn't gain any Attack. The more damage YOU do, the more that group hates YOU.
* Revenge is not limited to just Villains either. Masterminds can also hold a grudge. Big surprise there.

=== Noir ===

'''Investigate''': This keyword represents hard-bitten Noir detectives investigating mysteries and searching for evidence and allies.
* Some cards say things like "'''Investigate''' for a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card." That means "Look at the top two cards of your deck. Reveal a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card from among them and draw it. Put the rest of those cards back on the top and/or bottom of your deck in any order." Other abilities let you investigate for cards with certain costs, teams, icons, or other traits. (You only get to draw one card even if both cards match the Investigation. If at least one card matches, you must reveal and draw one card.)
* Whether your investigation finds the right kind of card or not, you can still decide which cards go back on the top or bottom of your deck. This lets you set up your next Investigation or make powerful combos with other abilities that care about the top card of your deck. (The cards that that you put back can be broken up between the top and bottom of your deck.)
* Some abilities tell you to investigate entirely different decks, like the Villain, Hero, and Bystander Decks. They will tell you what to do with the card you find. Like before, put the rest of the cards you looked at back on the top and/or bottom of that deck in any order.

'''Hidden Witness''': This keyword represents Villains and Masterminds hiding behind layers of informants, victims, and stooges. To find these Villains, you must track down and interview Hidden Witnesses who know their locations.
* Some Villains say things like "'''Ambush''': This Villain captures 2 '''Hidden Witnesses'''." This means the Villain captures the top 2 cards of the Bystander Stack, face-down, as Hidden Witnesses. You can't fight a Villain while it has a Hidden Witness.
* During your turn you can pay 2 Recruit to rescue a Hidden Witness any number of times and put it in your Victory Pile.
* Hidden Witnesses still count as Bystanders. When you rescue one, you get any special "When you rescue this Bystander ..." effect written on it. It stays in your Victory Pile as a normal, face-up Bystander.
* A Villain can have face-up Bystanders and face-down Hidden Witnesses at the same time. You'll need to pay to rescue the face-down Hidden Witnesses. Then, you can fight the Villain, which will automatically rescue the face-up Bystanders.
* If a Villain escapes with any number of Bystanders, including Hidden Witnesses, it will cause all players to discard a single card, just like a Villain escaping with any normal Bystanders. Hidden Witnesses carried away by escaping Villains stay in the Escape Pile as normal, face-up Bystanders.
* You can pay to rescue Hidden Witnesses even if you're not going to fight that Villain during that turn. You can also rescue just some of the Hidden Witnesses and leave others for later.
* If a special ability lets you "Defeat a Villain for free," you automatically rescue all the Hidden Witnesses on it without paying Recruit.
* Masterminds and Schemes can have Hidden Witnesses on them too. They work the same way.

=== X-Men ===

'''X-Gene''': This keyword represents X-Men combining unique mutant powers with their signature teamwork.
* Some Heroes say things like "X-Gene https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png: You get +2 Attack." This means "If you have a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png card in your discard pile, you get +2 Attack." You can use a card's X-Gene ability only if you have the specified kind of card in your discard pile.
* You can only use a card's X-Gene ability once, no matter how many matching cards you have in your discard pile.
* Remember: when you play a card during your turn, it stays in front of you until the end of turn. Then all the cards you played that turn go to the discard pile. So if you have an empty discard pile, you can't play a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card from your hand, then immediately play a card with "X-Gene https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png" and use that X-Gene ability.
* One cool combo is to recruit a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png Hero into your discard pile, then play your "X-Gene https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png" card, and you'll get to use its X-Gene ability.

'''Piercing Energy''': This keyword represents X-Men using psychic knives & sonic screams to pierce enemy defenses.
* Some Heroes give you a new kind of points called "Piercing Energy," using the Piercing icon. You can fight a Villain or Mastermind by spending Piercing points equal to that enemy's printed Victory Points value (VP). You ignore that enemy's Attack and any Attack modifiers.
* You can also ignore any special conditions for fighting that enemy, automatically rescuing any Human Shields.
* You can't use Piercing Energy against cards that have no printed VP value, like Shadow-X Villains, or Master Strikes that become Villains.

'''Berserk''': This keyword represents some X-Men going into a berserker rage of unpredictable violence.
* "Berserk" means "Discard the top card of your deck. You get +Attack equal to the discarded card's printed Attack." (So if the discarded card gives "2+ Attack", you just count 2.)
* Some cards say "Berserk, Berserk, Berserk" so you discard three cards in a row.
* Some cards say things like "Berserk. X-Gene https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png: You get +1 Attack." You do the card abilities in order, so Berserk might discard a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card from your deck, letting you use your X-Gene ability.
* Berserk gives no benefit from discarding printed Recruit or Piercing values.

'''Soaring Flight''': This ability represents X-Men flying into action as rapid reinforcements.
* "Soaring Flight" means "When you recruit this Hero, set it aside. At the end of this turn, add it to your new hand as an extra card."

'''Lightshow''': This keyword represents X-Men using fireworks and blinding bursts in spectacular combinations.
* Some Heroes say things like "Lightshow: You get +3 Attack." Once per turn, if you played at least two Lightshow cards this turn, you can use a single Lightshow ability from any of those cards.
* If you play three, four, or more Lightshow cards you still use only a single Lightshow ability.

'''Dominate''': This keyword represents Villains using telepathy, sorcery, or illusions to twist Heroes' minds to evil.
* Some Villains and Masterminds say they "Dominate" Hero cards from various places. This means "Put those Heroes under this enemy. This enemy gets +1 Attack for each Hero it's Dominating."
* When you fight that enemy, put one of those Dominated Heroes into each player's discard pile. You choose which player gets which Hero, including yourself. There might not be enough for every player to get one. KO any excess Dominated Heroes.
* If a Villain escapes, any Heroes Dominated by that Villain go to the Escape Pile too.

'''Human Shields''': This keyword represents enemies hiding behind innocent people to prevent Heroes' attacks.
* "Ambush: This Villain captures 2 Human Shields" means the Villain captures the top 2 cards of the Bystander Stack face-down. You can't fight a Villain while it has any Human Shields. During your turn, any number of times, you can pay Attack equal to that Villain's Attack value to rescue one of its Human Shields at random and put it in your Victory Pile. (The * on their Attack is a reminder.)
* A Villain can have face up Bystanders and face-down Human Shields at the same time. You'll need to pay to rescue the face-down Human Shields. Then you can fight the Villain, which will rescue the face-up Bystanders automatically.
* Human Shields still count as Bystanders. Villains escaping with Human Shields still make players discard as normal.

'''Traps''': The Legendary® X-Men set adds a completely new card type to Legendary®: Traps. Every Villain Group in the set contains at least one Trap.
* When a Trap is played from the Villain Deck, it gives you a challenge to complete this turn to avoid the Trap. If you complete the challenge, put the Trap in your Victory Pile and get its VP. A Trap is not a Villain and doesn't enter the city.
* If you fail to complete the challenge, then at the end of the turn you must KO the trap and suffer the listed consequences! (Do this after you draw a new hand).

'''Token Cards''': Sometimes game play will cause additional Villains or Masterminds to be added during play. For example, a Master Strike may cause a special Villain to enter the city. Token cards represent these special characters that would otherwise be represented by the card that drew them out. Tokens are all identified by a Token icon in the upper right of the card. These new cards are optional so have fun with them!

=== Spider-Man Homecoming ===

'''Danger Sense''': This keyword represents Spider-Man using his famous "Spider-Sense" superpower to detect danger and evade it. It also covers Tony Stark, Happy Hogan, and Vulture watching for threats and rapidly reacting to them.
* Some cards say things like "Danger Sense 2." This means "Reveal the top 2 cards of the Villain Deck. You get +1 Attack for each Villain you revealed. Put all the cards back on top in any order."
* Cards can say Danger Sense 1, 2, 3, or even 4, revealing that many cards.
* Several Danger Sense cards also say they have additional effects when they reveal particular kinds of cards.
* Sometimes you can use one Danger Sense card to put a particular card on top of the Villain Deck, and then use a different Danger Sense card to benefit from that card being on top of that deck.
* Danger Sense can also be a good way to delay nasty Scheme Twists, Master Strikes, and powerful Villains. But you won't be able to avoid them forever!

'''Striker''': This keyword represents Villains and Masterminds that get more confident and powerful as the Mastermind smashes Heroes. It means "This gets +1 Attack for each Master Strike in the KO pile and/or stacked next to the Mastermind."
* A couple of Hero cards also have the Striker ability and give you +Attack the same way.
* A couple of cards say "Double Striker," meaning they get +2 Attack per Strike, or even "Triple Striker" meaning +3 Attack per Strike.
By default, most Master Strikes go to the KO pile when they occur. However, some Masterminds specifically put their Master Strikes in unusual places. Striker also counts all face-up Master Strike cards in any of these unusual places. For example, for these Masterminds:
* Galactus - Count Master Strikes in the city.
* Macho Gomez - Count Master Strikes in front of all players.
* Deathbird - Count Master Strikes in the city, Escape Pile, and all players' Victory Piles.
* Mysterio - Count Master Strikes in all players' Victory Piles. Don't count Master Strikes shuffled into his Tactics, since they're not face up.

'''Coordinate''': This keyword represents how Tony Stark and May Parker act as mentors to Spider-Man in the movie, helping him reach his full potential and become a true hero.
Coordinating allows you to let another player "borrow" one of your cards. It is a critical way to help other players defeat tough enemies. During another player's turn, you can Coordinate with them like this:
* Discard a Coordinate card from your hand and then draw a new card to replace it.
* That player can now play a copy of the card you coordinated with them. (A copy counts as playing the exact same card including its Attack, Recruit, special abilities, and Hero Class symbol.)
You can only Coordinate one card to each player on their turn. However, multiple players can each Coordinate one card to the player whose turn it is, in order to give that player a huge advantage.
* If you are playing a solo game, once per turn, you may discard a card with Coordinate to draw a card.
* Coordinate is printed on cards in red text to make it easier to notice during other players' turns.
* When you offer to Coordinate a card to another player, that player can decline. If so, you don't discard that card and that player doesn't play a copy of it.
* If you are playing with the Final Showdown, you can't Coordinate during that Showdown.

=== Champions ===

'''Cheering Crowds''': This keyword represents the Champions being inspired to redouble their efforts by adoring fans.
* Several Hero cards say "Cheering Crowds." This means "You may play this card twice in a row if you return a Bystander from your Victory Pile to the bottom of the Bystander Stack."
Example 1: Say you have a Hero that gives 1 Recruit and says "Draw a card. '''Cheering Crowds'''." As you play this Hero, you could return a Bystander to play the Hero twice in a row, getting 2 Recruit and drawing two cards.
* Essentially you play the card itself, and then you play a bonus copy of that card.
Example 2: Say your first play of the turn was an https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png card that gives 2 Attack and says "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png: Draw a card. '''Cheering Crowds'''." You decide to return a Bystander to play this card twice in a row. The first play wouldn't get to use the "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png: Draw a card" ability, since you haven't played an https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png card earlier in the turn. However, the second play would get to use that Superpower ability, since you have now played an https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png card earlier in the turn. So you would end up getting 4 Attack and drawing one card.
* If you had played a different https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png card before doubling the Cheering Crowds card, then you could would get to use the "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png: Draw a card" ability both times, getting 4 Attack and drawing two cards.
Example 3: Say your first play is using Cheering Crowds to play a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card twice. Then, you play another card that says "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png: You get +1 Attack for each other https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png Hero you played this turn." That ability would count both plays of your Cheering Crowds card, giving you +2 Attack total.
* When playing out a big turn, some people like to put the Bystander they're returning temporarily on the Cheering Crowds card to remind themselves they've played it twice.
...
* If you use Cheering Crowds to play a '''Versatile''' card twice, you could get Recruit with one play and get Attack with the other play, or choose the same for both.

'''Size-Changing''' This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to stretch or massively change their size. It's also used by characters that can change the size of a weapon, technology, or energy. It first appeared in ''Legendary: Civil War'', but in this set it has a new twist.
...
* As a new Twist, some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "'''Size-Changing''' https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png." If you played any https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png Heroes this turn, the cost is 2 less. If you played any https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png Heroes, the cost is 2 less. If you played both a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png Hero and a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png Hero this turn, then the cost is 4 less.
* Fin Fang Foom and one of his Monsters Unleashed even say "'''Size-Changing''' https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png". You can pay 2 Attack less to fight them for each of these Hero Classes you played this turn.
* Note: For any Size-Changing card, it doesn't matter how many Heroes you played -- it only maters whether or not you played any Heroes of that Hero class.
* After you've recruited a card, Size-Changing doesn't do anything else on that card.
* If a Hero in the HQ already has "'''Size-Changing''' https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png" and it gains "'''Size-Changing''' https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png" from another special ability like the Sporr Villain, it just ends up with "'''Size-Changing''' https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png." A card can't have Size-Changing for the same Hero Class twice.


=== World War Hulk ===

'''Transform''': This keyword represents the themes of duality and transformation in Hulk stories.

Heroes:
* Each Hero in this set has some special "Transformed" cards that go along with it. When you use these Heroes, '''don't''' shuffle their "Transformed" cards into the Hero Deck. Instead, set them aside in a special Transformation Pile. You can't recruit cards from this pile. Instead, you transform other cards into them.
* Some Hero cards like "Bruce Banner: Gamma Ray Experiments" say things like "...Transform this into Savage Hulk Unleashed."
* When you play a Hero card that says it transforms into another card, you complete all effects on the card you played and get its normal Recruit and Attack.
* Then remove the transforming card from the game (putting it in the Transformation Pile) and put the newly transformed card into your hand instead (from the Transformation Pile). You can play the new Transformed card immediately that same turn.
* You still count as having played the transforming card you played and removed from the game, including effects like "You get +1 Attack for each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card you played this turn." But if an effect asks you to reveal one of your cards, you can only reveal the new, transformed card, not the old card that you removed from the game.
* Some transforming cards tell you to put the new card on top of your deck or in your discard pile instead.
* You can look through the Transformation Pile at any time.
* At the end of the game, store a Hero's Transformed cards with the rest of that Hero's cards. To start a game, you only need to bring out the Transformed cards for the Heroes you're using. Don't bring out all the Transformed cards in the entire game.
* If you sleeve your cards, you can put the Transformed version of the card in the same sleeve, behind the Transforming card. When it's time to transform, you just pull the back card to the front of the sleeve. It's a little thicker in the sleeve, but it still shuffles well.

Masterminds:
Each Mastermind in this set is a double-sided "Transforming Mastermind" that transforms back and forth between two forms during the game.
* The side with the "Always Leads" ability starts face up.
* When a Master Strike or Mastermind Tactic ability occurs, it will tell you to "Transform" the Mastermind, meaning flip it over to its other side. (Don't also do the Master Strike ability of the new side.)
* A Mastermind only uses the abilities and Attack of its currently face up side. Ignore the special abilities and values on the currently face down side.

'''Outwit''': This keyword represents how Bruce Banner, Amadeus Cho, the Illuminati, and the Intelligencia are among the smartest characters in the Marvel universe.
* Some Heroes say things like "Outwit: Draw a card."
* '''You can use this Outwit ability only if you reveal Heroes with 3 different costs.'''
* You can count the Outwit card itself. So you can reveal a 2-cost Hero in your hand, plus a 6-cost Outwit card and 0-cost S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Hero you already played.
* Some Villains and Masterminds also say they get stronger or harm you in special ways if you fail to Outwit them. For example: "'''Ambush''': If you can't Outwit the Leader, play the top card of the Villain Deck."
* You can choose not to Outwit, even if you are able.

'''Smash''': This keyword represents how when Hulks get angry, they SMASH hard, no matter what they have to toss aside.
* Some Heroes say things like "Smash 3." This means '''"You may discard another card from your hand. If you do, you get +3 Attack."'''

'''Wounded Fury''': This keyword represents how wounding a Hulk often just makes it ANGRIER and STRONGER! It also includes Villains attacking with more furious bloodlust as they wound you.
* When a Hero card says "Wounded Fury", it means '''"You get +1 Attack for each Wound in your discard pile."'''
* Likewise, when a Villain or Mastermind says "Wounded Fury", it means '''"It gets +1 Attack for each Wound in your discard pile."'''

'''Cross-Dimensional Rampage''': As different Hulks rampage across planets and dimensions, only another Hulk can stop them! This keyword debuted in Legendary: Secret Wars.
* "Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage" means '''"Each player reveals one of their Hulk Heroes or a Hulk card in their Victory Pile or gains a Wound."'''
* You can reveal any card that includes the word "Hulk" in its card name, Hero name, Villain Group name, or Tactics for Hulk Masterminds. This includes any Red Hulk, She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, Skaar, Son of Hulk, Joe Fixit Grey Hulk, Hulkling, Hulk Gang, Cosmic Hulk Robot, Hulkbuster, Enchain the Hulk, and so on.
* You don't need to know the whole history of Marvel comics to judge who counts as a Hulk – just rely on whether the card says Hulk in its name or not. There are only a few, very specific exceptions we have to make to stay true to the characters:
** "Nul, Breaker of Worlds" from Fear Itself and "Maestro" (core set) count as Hulks for this.
** "Weapon X" and "Old Man Logan" count as Wolverines for "Cross-Dimensional Wolverine Rampage" in other sets.
* Some Heroes in this set can transform into Hulks, like Bruce Banner and Amadeus Cho. A puny "Bruce Banner" card doesn't say "Hulk" on it, so it can't stop a Hulk Rampage. But revealing the transformed Bruce Banner card named "Savage Hulk Unleashed" works.
* When a Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage happens, you can choose to gain the Wound, even if you have a Hulk that you already played or could otherwise reveal. You might want the Wound if you have Wounded Fury cards.
* There are also Cross-Dimensional Void Rampages, etc.

=== Marvel Studios Phase 1 ===

'''Conqueror''': Some Villain cards have a special ability called "Conqueror," representing their desire to conquer and hold a specific part of the city. For example, the Chitauri Soldier Villain has the ability "'''Rooftops Conqueror 2.'''" This ability means This Villain gets +2 Attack while any Villain is in the rooftops." So the Chitauri Soldier gets this Attack bonus while it itself on the Rooftops, or when a completely different Villain is on the Rooftops. The Chitauri Soldier doesn't care if the Villain on the Rooftops has a Conqueror ability or not. Other Villains and the Iron Monger Mastermind have different Conqueror abilities, with different Attack bonus numbers and referring to different city spaces.

=== Ant-Man ===

'''Size-Changing''' This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to shrink, grow, or massively change their size. It's also used by characters that can change the size of a weapon, technology, or energy. It first debuted in ''Legendary Civil War'' and also appeared in ''Legendary Champions''.

* Some Hero cards say things like "Size-Changing https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png." This means '''"You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less if you played any https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png cards this turn."'''
* Likewise, some Villain cards say things like "Size-Changing https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png." This means '''"You can fight this Villain for 2 Attack less if you played any https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png cards this turn."'''
* Note: For a typical Size-Changing card, it doesn't matter how many Heroes of that Hero Class you played – it only matters if you played any Heroes of that Hero Class or not.
* After you've recruited a card, Size-Changing doesn't do anything else on that card.

'''Microscopic Size-Changing''' Far beyond other Heroes that can stretch or grow, Ant-Man and Wasp can change their size to a whole new scale. They can shrink down smaller than an atom, to the quantum Microverse. Here, the very laws of physics can be broken and even reversed! This ability works like regular Size- Changing, but with a couple of twists.
* Some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "Microscopic Size-Changing https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png. "
* This means '''"You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less for each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card you played this turn, counting up to three https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png cards."'''
* So if you played one https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png Hero this turn, this card costs 2 less. If you played two https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png Heroes, it costs 4 less. If you played three or more https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png Heroes, it costs 6 less.
* Playing a fourth https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card wouldn’t '''reduce this cost any further since there are only three https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png icons listed in this particular Microscopic Size- Changing ability.
* The second twist is that Microscopic Size- Changing can actually reduce a card’s Recruit cost to zero or even a negative number!''' When you recruit a Microscopic Size-Changing Hero with a negative cost, '''you actually gain that many Recruit points'''!
* Some Villains also have Microscopic Size- Changing. It works the same way, letting you fight that Villain for 2 Attack less for each card of the correct color you played this turn, counting up to the number of icons shown in the Microscopic Size-Changing ability.
* Likewise, if you fight a Villain with Microscopic Size-Changing and reduce its Attack value to a negative number, you actually gain that many Attack points when you fight it. You don’t even need to have any Attack points before you fight them.
* For example, say you play five https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png Heroes, then fight a Villain with 3 Attack and "Microscopic Size-Changing https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png." The Villain's Attack decreases to -5, and you actually gain 5 Attack when you fight them! (The 5th https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png Hero you played didn’t reduce the Attack, since the Microscopic Size- Changing ability only had 4 icons.)
* Building the right deck and shrinking down to the crazy backwards physics of the Microverse can create some very powerful turns!

'''Empowered''': This keyword represents Heroes and Villains who draw power from ambient energy, technology, or superpowers around them.
* Some Heroes say things like "You get '''Empowered''' by https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png." This means '''"You get +1 Attack for each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png card in the HQ."'''
* Likewise, some Villains and Masterminds say things like "'''Empowered''' by https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png". This means '''"This gets +1 Attack for each https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png card in the HQ."'''
* As cards enter and leave the HQ, an Empowered card can get stronger or weaker. You only check the Attack bonus at the moment you play your Empowered Hero or at the moment you fight the Empowered enemy.
* One clever move is to recruit a Hero from the HQ at the right time, changing the colors in the HQ to weaken an Empowered enemy or try to strengthen an Empowered Hero in your hand.
* Some cards are even "Double Empowered" or "Triple Empowered" meaning that they get +2 Attack or +3 Attack for each appropriate card in the HQ.
* (A multicolored or divided card from other sets counts if either half is the correct color. For example, an "Empowered by https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png and https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png" ability can get +1 Attack from a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png card or from a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png card. However, a "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png" card in the HQ would only give +1 Attack, not +2 Attack.)

'''Chivalrous Duel''': This keyword represents how Morgan le Fay and the knights of her "Queen's Vengeance" hail from a realm of honorable single combat. You can't gang up on an enemy in a Chivalrous Duel – you have to pick just one Hero Name to duel the enemy.
* '''To fight an enemy with "Chivalrous Duel," you can only use Attack from a single Hero Name.'''
* For example, to fight a 3 Attack Villain with Chivalrous Duel, you can spend 3 Attack from two different Black Knight hero cards. But you can't combine 2 Attack from Black Knight cards and 1 Attack from a Wasp card.
* If a Hero like "S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper" doesn't have a Hero Name listed, then its Hero Name is the same as its card name. So you can play three S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers then fight a 3 Attack Villain with Chivalrous Duel. But you can't spend 2 Attack from Black Knight cards and 1 Attack from a S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper to fight an enemy with Chivalrous Duel.
* (You can't use Attack you get from anything that's not a Hero card, including Microscopic Size-Changing Villains, Mastermind Tactics, Shard tokens from other sets, etc. You can use Attack from Hero Artifacts in other sets with the right Hero Name, since those are Hero cards.)
* In a setup with lots of Chivalrous Duels, like fighting Morgan le Fay or the Scheme "Pull Earth into Medieval Times," you will want to build your deck to concentrate your Attack cards into just one or two Hero Names!

=== Venom ===

'''Symbiote Bonds''': This keyword represents how symbiotes like Hybrid, Riot, and Lasher bond with other characters, enhancing them with a dark shell. You must fight the combined strength of the host and symbiote to split them apart, then finish what remains in a second fight.
* Some Villains say things like "'''Ambush''': A Henchman Villain from your Victory Pile '''Symbiote Bonds''' with Lasher."
* '''This means stack this card onto the specified Villain, combining them into a single Villain with both cards' Attack and text added together.'''
* To fight a Combined Villain, you must spend the total Attack of both Villain cards combined. Rescue all the Bystanders that Combined Villain had. '''Then put either one of the Villain cards from that Combined Villain into your Victory Pile and do that card's Fight effect.''' The other card from that Combined Villain stays in that city space, and you don't do its Fight effect.
* '''If a Combined Villain escapes''', it's only a single escape, so it only KOs one Hero that costs 6 or less from the HQ. (If it's carrying any number of Bystanders, it makes all players discard a single card as normal.) Do the Escape abilities of both those Villain cards in any order. Once in the Escape Pile, they are two unattached Villains again.
* Keep one card of the Combined Villain tucked under the other, so you can see both cards' Attack and text.
* Since a Combined Villain has the text of both its Villain cards, it can get extra Attack or restrictions from various special abilities on either of its cards. It also counts as both cards' Villain Groups.
* Symbiote Bonds never combine more than two Villains in the same city space. Ignore any effect that would combine a third Villain in that space.
* Once two Villains are bonded, only fighting can break them up. Other Symbiote Bonds abilities can't break up a Combined Villain to attach one of the cards to something else.
* If a Symbiote Bonds ability puts a new Villain card into the city from the Villain Deck, Escape Pile, Victory Pile, etc., do any Ambush ability on the newly entering card. However, that Ambush ability won't be able to break up a Combined Villain or add a third card to it.
* If a special ability automatically "defeats" a Combined Villain, you still put just one of its cards into your Victory Pile and do that card's Fight effect.
* A combined Villain has the VP of both its cards combined. So you can spend Piercing Energy (from ''Legendary: X-Men'') equal to both cards' total combined VP to fight the Combined Villain, putting one of its cards into your Victory Pile as normal.

'''Poison Villains''': * Poison Villains use Symbiote Bonds in a special way. For example, Poison Dr. Octopus says "'''Fight''': This '''Symbiote Bonds''' with a Villain in the Bank. If already bonded or unable to bond, gain this as a Hero instead."
* So Dr. Octopus enters the city as a normal Villain. When you fight him, if there's a Villain in the Bank, then Poison Dr. Octopus will bond with that Villain. If there's no Villain in the Bank, then you gain Poison Dr. Octopus as a Hero instead, putting him in your discard pile.
* Once Poison Dr. Octopus becomes bonded, if you fight that Combined Villain, you choose one of the two Villains and do its Fight effect. If you choose Poison Dr. Octopus, then since he is currently bonded, you gain him as a Hero.
* When facing Poison Villains, be careful about when you fight them, so you can turn them into Heroes as soon as possible!

'''Digest''': This grisly keyword represents how the Venom and Carnage symbiotes get stronger as they devour people and absorb their energy.
* Some Heroes say things like "'''Digest 2''': Draw a card."
* '''Use this Digest ability only if you have at least that many cards in your Victory Pile.'''
* All kinds of cards in your Victory Pile count for Digest. This includes Henchman Villains, regular Villains, Bystanders, Mastermind Tactics, Traps from other sets, etc.
* You don't have to remove any cards from your Victory Pile to use Digest.
* Even if you have 10 cards in your Victory Pile, you can't use a card's "Digest 2" ability five times -- just once.

'''Indigestion''':
* '''If you don't have enough cards in your Victory Pile to use a card's Digest ability, use its Indigestion ability instead.'''
* For example, some Heroes say things like: "'''Digest 4''': Draw two cards.
'''Indigestion''': You get +2 Recruit."
* When you play this card, if you have at least 4 cards in your Victory Pile, then you use the Digest ability and draw two cards.
* If you have zero to three cards in your Victory Pile, then you use the Indigestion ability instead, getting +2 Recruit.
* If you have enough cards in your Victory Pile to use the Digest ability, you cannot choose to use the Indigestion ability instead.

'''Excessive Violence''': See Deadpool.

=== Dimensions ===

'''Switcheroo''': This new keyword represents how Heroes like Squirrel Girl and Jessica Jones unpredictably switch up their tactics. Sometimes they instantly switch to new fighting stances, while other times they switch in new Heroes altogether.
* Some Hero cards say things like "'''Switcheroo 4'''."
* This means “You can reveal this card from your hand and put it on the bottom of the Hero Deck. If you do, you may put a Hero of the specified printed cost from the HQ into your hand.”
* So when you have a Switcheroo card in your hand, you can choose to play it for its normal Recruit, Attack, and other effects. Or you can choose to permanently swap it for another card in the HQ instead.
* You use Switcheroo ''instead'' of playing the card. So when you Switcheroo, you don’t get any Recruit, Attack, or other effects from the Switcheroo card that you put on the bottom of the Hero Deck.
* '''Remember''': You put the Switcheroo card on the bottom of the collective Hero Deck on the board – not your personal deck.
* It’s totally fine to Switcheroo into a card of a different Hero Name.
* You can only use Switcheroo during your turn, when you could play cards from your hand. So you can’t use it during other players’ turns, and you can’t use it while playing a card from the Villain Deck, like during a Master Strike, Scheme Twist, or Villain’s Ambush ability.
* You can’t Switcheroo into S.H.I.E.L.D. Officers or Sidekicks, since they aren’t in the HQ.
* Switcheroo doesn’t count as “recruiting” a Hero, so you can’t use abilities like Wall-Crawl or Soaring Flight when you Switcheroo.
* Switcheroo uses the “printed cost” of cards in the HQ, so even if special abilities make cards in the HQ cost more or less, Switcheroo still uses the cost number literally printed on the card.

'''Investigate''': See Noir.
This keyword represents hard-bitten detectives like Jessica Jones investigating mysteries and searching for evidence and allies. Squirrel Girl has her furry friends investigate for her, while Ms. America investigates dimensional disruptions.
* Note that Howard the Duck is also a private investigator. Many of his cards work similarly to the Investigate keyword and combine well with Investigate cards. However, Howard doesn’t literally Investigate, since his cards originally came out in Marvel 3D before Investigate existed.

'''Teleport''': See Dark City.

=== Revelations ===

'''Hyperspeed''': This new keyword represents how Heroes like Quicksilver and Speed move blindingly fast, battering opponents with a flurry of unpredictable strikes. It also includes hyperspeed flight, hypersonic cannons and hyper-fast volleys of arrows.
* Some Hero cards say things like "Hyperspeed 5." This means "'''Reveal the top 5 cards of your deck. You get +1 Attack for each card with an Attack icon you revealed this way. Discard all those cards.'''"
* It doesn't matter what numbers are in the Attack icons. Ignore Recruit and other icons on the revealed cards.
* When building a deck with lots of Hyperspeed, you will want as many cards with Attack icons as you can get - including cards with "0+" printed inside their Attack icon.
* You can also cleverly use abilities that let you set up the top card of your deck to have an Attack icon right before you play a card with Hyperspeed.
* Some cards explicitly tell you to "Hyperspeed 3 for Recruit." This means "Reveal the to 3 cards of your deck. You get +1 Recruit for each card with a Recruit icon you revealed this way. Discard all those cards."
* Finally, some cards say "Hyperspeed 3 for Recruit and Attack." In this case, if you revealed one card with a Recruit icon and two cards that each had Recruit and Attack icons, you would get +3 Recruit and +2 Attack. Cards with both Recruit and Attack icons can be very useful with Hyperspeed!

'''Dark Memories''': In the theme of Revelations, this new keyword represents the way The Hood and his gang find every dark secret in a Hero's past and use it against them.
* Some Villains and Masterminds have the keyword "Dark Memories." This means "'''This gets +1 Attack for each Hero Class among cards in your discard pile.'''"
* Likewise, some Hero cards like Ronin and Scarlet Witch also have "Dark Memories," drawing power from the tragedies of their pasts. Playing a Hero card with this keyword gives you that same bonus: "You get +1 Attack for each Hero Class among cards in your discard pile."
* The Hero Classes are https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png, and https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png, so Dark Memories can give anywhere from +0 Attack to +5 Attack. Grey cards like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents don't have a Hero Class.
* It doesn't matter how many cards of a particular Hero Class you have in your discard pile. So if your discard pile were three https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png cards, four https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png cards, and five grey S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, Dark Memories would give you +2 Attack.
* Recruiting Heroes, Hyperspeed, and other discard abilities may increase the Dark Memories bonus. Likewise, if you draw of reveal enough cards that you have to shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, the Dark Memories bonus will go back to +0 Attack. Time your plays and build your deck carefully to turn Dark Memories to your advantage!
* You can minimize the Attack of The Hood and his gang by building a deck with very few Hero Classes. Or you can maximize the Attack of Heroes with Dark Memories by recruiting many Hero Classes.
* "Double Dark Memories" means double the bonus.

'''Last Stand''': This new keyword represents how a Dark Avenger fights hardest when all alone, back to a wall, making a last stand. Treacherous and cruel , they don't understand the teamwork of the real Avengers.
* Some Villains say "Last Stand." This means "'''This gets +1 Attack for each empty space in the city.'''"
* Some Captain Marvel and Photon cards also say "Last Stand," representing how they fight their hardest near the end of battle. Likewise, this means "'''You get +1 Attack for each empty space in the city.'''"
* Choose the order you fight Villains carefully when Last Stand is in the game!
* If a Mastermind or Scheme causes a city space not to exist, that does not count as an "empty space."
* "Double Last Stand" means double the bonus.

'''Locations''': The Revelations set adds a completely new card type to Marvel Legendary" '''Locations'''. These cards represent infamous strongholds in the Marvel Universe. Every Villain Group in the set contains at least one Location.
* When a Location is played from the Villain Deck, place it above the nearest city space that does not have a Location. Leave enough room that Villains can move through the city as normal.
* Once placed, Locations don’t move. Villains don’t push Locations forward. You can have a Villain in a city space that has a Location above it.
* Most Locations specify special abilities that happen when you fight Villains in that space. Some Locations become stronger when there’s a Villain in that space. Some Villains and Masterminds say they become stronger based on Locations.
* You can fight a Location by spending the listed amount of Attack, putting it into your Victory Pile, and doing any Fight ability the Location may have.
* If a new Location is played, and every city space already has a Location, then KO the Location with the lowest Attack to make room. (If tied, the current player chooses.) This might KO the newly played Location or one of the previous Locations.
* In 1-player solo mode, when a Location tells "each other player" to do something, do it yourself.

'''Location Clarifications'''
* '''Locations do not count as Villains'''. Special abilities that mention Villains do not work on Locations.
* If a Mastermind or Scheme destroys a city space with a Location, KO that Location.
* A city space with a Location above it and no Villains still counts as "empty" for abilities like Last Stand.
* Each Mastermind in the set has at least one Tactic that becomes a Location. You win when the Mastermind has no face down Tactics left under them. You don't also have to defeat all the Tactic cards that have turned into Locations in the city.
* Locations don't usually capture Bystanders, but some card abilities can make them capture Bystanders. Rescue them when you fight that Location.

'''Double-Sided Transforming Schemes'''
In keeping with the Revelations theme, all the Schemes in this set are double-sided "Transforming Schemes." Start with the side face up that says "Setup." Whenever it tells you to "Transform this Scheme," flip it over. Use only the rules showing on the side currently face up.

=== S.H.I.E.L.D. ===

'''Undercover''': This new keyword represents sending S.H.I.E.L.D. agents off the grid on special missions to recover valuable intel.
* Some cards say things like "You may send a S.H.I.E.L.D. Hero from your hand Undercover." This means "'''Put that Hero into your Victory Pile. It's worth 1VP.'''"
*This helps get your starting S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and Troopers out of your deck so that you draw your more powerful Heroes more often. You can also use it to get rid of other S.H.I.E.L.D. cards like Officers that you might not need later in the game. The main heroes in this set are all part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team too, so you can also send their cards Undercover.
* If you play a card, and it sends itself Undercover, you still get its Recruit and Attack.
* Sending S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes Undercover is also key to increasing your S.H.I.E.L.D. Level, as shown below.

'''S.H.I.E.L.D. Level''': This new keyword represents how S.H.I.E.L.D. agents unlock special operations, resources, and abilities as they rise through the ranks of the organization. Sending agents on undercover missions, fighting Hydra, and defeating rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives are all good ways to increase your S.H.I.E.L.D. Level.
* '''Your S.H.I.E.L.D. Level is the number of S.H.I.E.L.D. and/or HYDRA cards in your Victory Pile.'''
* Some cards say things like "S.H.I.E.L.D. level 2: Draw a card." You can use this ability only if your S.H.I.E.L.D. Level is 2 or higher.
* This counts any card with the S.H.I.E.L.D. or HYDRA team icons, as well as any card with "S.H.I.E.L.D." or "Hydra" in its card name, Villain Group name, or Mastermind name. So this includes S.H.I.E.L.D. Assault Squads, Hydra Kidnappers, Hydra High Council Tactics, etc.
* This never consumes the cards in your Victory Pile - it just checks to make sure you have them.
* Heroes that use S.H.I.E.L.D. Level all have ways to get the needed cards into your Victory Pile.
* Note: When playing with Hydra Villain Groups and/or multiple Heroes that use S.H.I.E.L.D. Levels, your S.H.I.E.L.D. Levels will naturally be higher.

'''Hydra Level''': Some Villain Groups also try to rise through the ranks of the Hydra organization, achieving higher Hydra Levels and ever-greater power. To do this, they help Hydra operatives achieve their missions and escape the city unharmed. They also subvert double agents to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D., then escape it with key intel.
* '''The Hydra Level is the number of S.H.I.E.L.D. and/or HYDRA cards in the Escape Pile.'''
* Some Villains and Masterminds say things like "Growing Man gets + Attack equal to the Hydra Level."
* Like S.H.I.E.L.D. Level, this includes any card with the S.H.I.E.L.D. or HYDRA team icons, as well as any card with "S.H.I.E.L.D." or "Hydra" in its card name, Villain Group name, or Mastermind name.
* Some abilities put S.H.I.E.L.D. cards directly from S.H.I.E.L.D. Officer Stack into the Escape Pile to increase the Hydra Level. This is not an "escape" unless it's a Villain escaping from the city, so it won't KO a Hero of cost 6 or less from the HQ.

'''Adapting Masterminds''': The Hydra Super-Adaptoid and the Hydra High Council constantly adapt their tactics to attack the Heroes in new ways. Accordingly, each of these Masterminds is a new "Adapting Mastermind" with 4 different Master Strikes. Here's how they work.
* A normal Mastermind has a Mastermind card and 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. An Adapting Mastermind instead has just 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. Whichever Tactic is currently on top of the stack of Tactics counts as the current Mastermind card.
* Say you are using Hydra Super-Adaptoid as your Mastermind. Keep all his Tactics in a face up stack. Use only the rules on the top card, ignoring the rest of the cards in the stack.
* Whenever an Adapting Mastermind does a Master Strike, it says "'''Adapt'''" at the end. This means "'''Shuffle the Mastermind Tactics and randomly put one on top, face up.'''" You might randomly pick the same Tactic that was previously on top, pr it might be a different Tactic.
* Likewise, when you fight an Adapting Mastermind, you always fight the Tactic currently on top of the stack. You ignore all the card abilities and Attack bonuses that are not currently on top of the stack. The "Fight" ability also says "Adapt" at the end. So you put the Tactic you just fought into your Victory Pile, do its Fight effect, then shuffle the remaining Tactics and randomly put one on top, face up.


=== Heroes of Asgard ===

'''Worthy''': Many Marvel stories involve Thor and others proving whether they are worth of wielding Asgard's mightiest weapons, like Mjolnir and Stormbreaker. This is represented by the new "Worthy" keyword. Some Hero cards say things like "If you are Worthy, draw a card."
* '''You are Worthy if you have a Hero that costs 5 or more.'''
* As usual, the phrases "your Heroes" and "Heroes you have" include both cards in your hand and cards you have played this turn. They also include Hero Artifacts you control. (Heroes in your deck and discard pile don't count.)
* Some Villains and Schemes also check if you are Worthy and reward or punish you accordingly.
* When you consider whether to recruit a card that asks you to be Worthy, you may find yourself hesitating, wondering whether you truly have enough to prove Worthy at the crucial moment. This is a great fit to how Thor and other Heroes question whether they will be Worthy at the crucial moment in Marvel stories.

'''Artifacts''': See Guardians of the Galaxy

'''Thrown Artifacts''': See Fear Itself.

'''Villainous Weapons''': As a new Twist on the Artifacts of past sets, Legendary: Heroes of Asgard introduces an all-new card type: "Villainous Weapons." Villains and Masterminds can capture these ancient weapons to become even more powerful. But if you defeat them, you can seize those weapons to use as Artifacts of your own.
* Each Villain Group in this set includes cards that say "Villainous Weapon." These are not Villains.
* When a Villainous Weapon is played from the Villain Deck, '''the Weapon is captured by the Villain in the city that's closest to the Villain Deck. If there are no Villains in the city, then KO the Weapon instead.'''
* Villainous Weapons empower the Villain holding them, adding the Attack bonus printed on the Weapon. Tuck the Weapon under the Villain so you can see the Weapon's Attack bonus right under the Villain's Attack.
* An enemy can use any number of Weapons at the same time, getting all of their bonuses combined.
* '''When a Villain with any number of Villainous Weapons escapes the city, the Mastermind captures all those Weapons,''' getting their Attack bonuses.
* When you fight a Villain or Mastermind holding any number of Weapons, '''put all those Weapons into your discard pile as Artifacts.'''
* When you have a Villainous Weapon in your hand, you can play it just like any other Artifact.
* '''You never get the Weapon's printed Attack bonus''' when you play the Artifact or control it. Only Villains and Masterminds get that Attack bonus. You only get the specific Artifact abilities written on the card.
* Villainous Weapons you have captures as Artifacts '''have 0 costs,''' have no color of Hero Class, and don't count as Hero cards or Villain cards. Since they have no cost, Villainous Weapons can never make you Worthy. (How appropriate...)
* If you have gained a Villainous Weapon, and a card effect makes an enemy capture that Weapon again, then it works as a Villainous Weapon Again until someone defeats that enemy to reclaim it.
* Malekith and Hela both have Mastermind Tactics that run into Villainous Weapons. You win when the Mastermind has no face down Tactics left under them, even if there are still some Tactics that have turned into other card types somewhere.

'''Conqueror''': See Marvel Studios Phase 1


=== New Mutants ===

'''Moonlight and Sunlight''': As a werewolf, Wolfsbane gets extra powerful at night or under a full moon. By contrast, Sunspot absorbs solar energy to fuel his powers, gaining strength from the force of full sunlight. To fight at their best, they must carefully consider when to engage the enemy, by moonlight or sunlight. This is represented by this new matched pair of keywords.
* Some Hero cards say things like "'''Moonlight''': You get +2 Attack." Others say things like "'''Sunlight''': Draw a card."
* '''Moonlight abilities work only when most of the Heroes in the HQ have odd-numbered costs. Likewise, Sunlight abilites work only when most of the Heroes in the HQ have even-numbered costs.'''
* Besides Heroes, some Villains and Masterminds also say get extra Attack or abilities during Moonlight or Sunlight.
* If there are a tied number of odd and even-numbered Heroes in the HQ (because some HQ spaces have been added or destroyed), then neither Moonlight nor Sunlight is in effect.
* Only the printed costs matter. Abilities that change the costs of Heroes in the HQ won't affect Moonlight or Sunlight.
* "Divided Cards" from ''Civil War'' and other sets count as just one card for Moonlight/Sunlight.

'''Moonlight and Sunlight Timing''': As always, do a cards abilities in the order they are listed. You check Moonlight or Sunlight at the moment when you would use that ability.
* For example. Sunspot has a card that says "'''Moonlight''': You may put a Hero form the HQ on the bottom of the Hero Deck. '''Sunlight''': Draw a card." Sunspot's cards primarily benefit from Sunlight, so the Moonlight ability here mostly helps him push the HQ towards Sunlight.
* You do these abilities in the order they are listed. So if there are three off-numbered cards in the HQ, and you play this card, you might be able to use the Moonlight ability to change the HQ to have only two odd-numbered cards, and then you could immediately use the Sunlight ability.
* Once you are completely done playing a Hero card or fighting a Villain with a Moonlight or Sunlight ability, move on. If later in the turn you change Moonlight or Sunlight, you don't go back in time to change the past.

'''Waking Nightmare''': The New Mutants often confront demons, monsters, sadists, trauma, and psychological horror. This keyword represents these attacks on their sanity. It's also used to represent how the Hero Mirage uses her powers to bring dream and nightmare constructs to life.
* Some cards tell you to "have a Waking Nightmare." This means "'''Discard a non-grey Hero from your hand. If you discard a Hero this way, draw a card.'''"
* Getting pummeled by Waking Nightmares can downgrade your hand from powerful superheroes to mere S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents. However, you can sometimes find new courage in a nightmare you may be able to discard a non-grey Hero you don't need very much and have a chance to draw something more helpful.
* Some Mirage Hero Cards also let you have a Waking Nightmare and give you specific benefits for it.

'''Conflicting Card Abilities''': When two card effects tell you to do different things with a card at the same time, you can choose which to do. So when you discard Empathic Link to Belasco of the Demon Bear, you can use the Empathic Link ability to set itself aside instead of letting Belasco KO it or the Demon Bear capture it. The Demon Bear will capture another player's discarded Hero instead. When you discard Empathic Link to a Waking Nightmare and set it aside, you still draw a card for the Waking Nightmare.


=== Into the Cosmos ===

'''Shards''': See Guardians of the Galaxy, with one change:
There is no limit to the number of Shards that can be in the game at once. (This is a change from the past, when the number of Shards was limited.)

'''Burning Shards''': As a new ability in this set, some Heroes say things like "Burn 2 Shards: Draw two cards."
* This means: '''Once this turn, you may spend that many Shards to do the listed effect.'''
* You can wait to use this until later in the turn.
* You don't get the normal +1 Attack per Shard when you burn the Shards this way.

'''Danger Sense''': See Spider-Man: Homecoming

'''Danger Sense on Villains''': The arrival of the Black Order of Thanos often signals a world's imminent destruction. Although that world can sense grave danger approaching, they are often powerless to stop it. The Black Order work together to guard each other and their lord. To represent this, these Villains use Danger Sense in a new way.
* Some cards say "Ambush: Danger Sense 2, helping all Black Order Villains and the Mastermind."
* To do this, reveal the top cards of the Villain Deck and rearrange them, just like normal Danger Sense. However, '''the +1 Attack bonus for each Villain card revealed is gained by all Black Order Villains in the city and the Mastermind this turn, instead of being gained by a player.'''
* This bonus wears off at the end of the turn.

'''Celestial Boons''': The Celestials are millions of years old and immeasurably powerful. They cannot be truly defeated by mere mortals. However, if you manage to fight a celestial, it is impressed with your efforts and grants you a Celestial Boon. '''This is a permanent bonus that helps you for the rest of the game,''' as long as the Celestial is in your Victory Pile. You can use multiple Celestial Boons, even multiple copies of the same one.

'''Contest of Champions''': The Grandmaster and the Elders of the Universe are literally immortal. To them, mortals are merely playthings. This is shown with the new Contest of Champions keyword. Some Villains and Masterminds say things like "Ambush: Contest of Champions https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png." When this happens:
* Each player in turn reveals a single card, either from their hand, or the top of their deck. That player announces their "Contest Score," which is that card's printed cost, doubled if it's a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png card.
* You must choose carefully whether to use the best score you have from your hand, or to take a risk by trying the top card of your deck instead.
* After all players have announced their Contest Score, then Evil tries to win the contest. Reveal the top two cards of the Hero Deck, and Evil uses whichever card gives the highest Contest Score ''(taking account of any doubling)''. Again, this is the card's printed cost, doubled if it's a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png card. Then put both those cards on the bottom of the Hero Deck.
* Whichever score is highest ''(or tied for highest)'' "wins" the contest. Everyone else "loses."
* For example, in a 3-player game, say Alana's score is 6, Piper's score is 6, Melody'd score is 4, and Evil's score is 6. The Alana, Piper, and the Mastermind all win the contest, and Melody loses the contest.
* The card lists outcomes for winning and losing.
* A few cards reveal a Hero card and use its colors for a contest. This can create contests that are multicolor, such as "Contest of Champions https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png, https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png." In this case, any card that includes either https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png will match the contest and have its score doubled. ''(A card that's both https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png and https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png won't be quadrupled.)''
* Some contests say that Evil reveals 4 or 6 cards from the Hero Deck. Evil's Contest Score is still the highest-scoring single card.

'''Cosmic Threat''': See Fantastic Four, and also:
* The Celestials say things like "Cosmic Threat https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png." You can choose to use either https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png cards for its Cosmic Threat in a single turn, '''but you can't use both to reduce its Attack.'''
* If you try to fight a Mastermind with Cosmic Threat a second time in the same turn, it will return to its full Attack, and you cannot use any Cosmic Threat abilities against it in additional fights that turn.
* You can use the same https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26285_0.png cards to reduce the Attack on different "Cosmic Threat https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26286_0.png or https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png" Villains in one turn.


=== Realm of Kings ===

'''"When Recruited" Abilities''': The Inhumans' powerful decision to go to war is shown with new special abilities they use "When Recruited."
* Some Heroes say things like: "When Recruited: You get '''+3''' Attack." '''Use this "When Recruited" ability immediately when you recruit this Hero.'''
* You pay the Hero's normal recruit cost, move it from the HQ into your discard pile, and refill that HQ space with a card from the Hero Deck. When all that is done, then you must use then "When Recruited" ability.
* When you play that card from your hand in later turns, don't use the "When Recruited" ability again. Instead, use the card's normal abilities, Recruit, and Attack. A horizontal line seperates the "When Recruited" ability from the card's normal abilities.
* If a special ability tells you to '''"gain"''' a Hero or '''"put"''' a Hero somewhere, then you '''don't''' use that Hero's "When Recruited" ability, since you didn't pay Recruit and you didn't recruit that Hero. This is true even if the special ability tells you to "gain" the Hero from the HQ.
* However, you '''do''' use the "When Recruited" ability if a special ability lets you "recruit a Hero for free" or recruit it at a reduced cost or from some unusual place, since then you are still recruiting the Hero.
* You may wish to keep some Heroes in the HQ until you especially need their "When Recruited" ability.

'''Throne's Favor'''
* Some Heroes say "You gain the Throne's Favor." When this happens, take a nearby object to represent the Throne's Favor in the game. If another player or Mastermind already has the Throne's Favor, and you gain it, then you take it from them.
* If an ability tells you to gain the Throne's Favor, you must take it. You cannot leave it where it is.
* Some Heroes say things like "You may spend the Throne's Favor to draw two cards." This means '''if you have the Throne's Favor, you may give it up to use the listed ability.''' You set aside the Throne's Favor object, and no one has the Throne's Favor until someone gains it again.
* You can only spend the Throne's Favor at the moment the card tells you to do so. You can't wait and spend it later in the turn.
* Masterminds and Villains in this set have abilities that can cause the Mastermind to gain the Throne's Favor and/or benefit from having it. Then the Mastermind gains the Throne's Favor, they take it away form any player that may already have it.
* The Throne's Favor is not a card. It never goes into decks or discard piles. Instead, when it comes up, just use whatever cool object is easily at hand. There's no need to store a special Throne's Favor object with the game.

'''Abomination''': Some Inhuman Villains have become horrific, unpredictable, and even monstrous. Accordingly, they use the "Abomination" keyword that debuted in Legendary: Captain America 75th Anniversary in 2016.
* There are also a few new twists on the Abomination keyword. The Hero Gorgon has abilities like '''"Sewers Abomination."''' It gives Attack equal to the printed Attack of the Hero in the HQ space under the Sewers.
* The highly-evolved Mastermind Maximus and Gorgon also use '''"Highest Abomination."''' This gives Attack equal to the highest printied Attack of any single card in the HQ. So if the five Heroes in the HQ have printed Attack of 2, 4, 3+, 0+, and no printed Attack, then Highest Abomination would give 4 Attack.
* '''"Double Abomination"''' double the Attack bonus.
* Some "Divided Cards" from sets like Legendary: Civil War have two printed Attack numbers, one on each side. If you need to know that card's "printed Attack," and the card is not currently being played, add both those Attack numbers together. This applies to Abomination and Berserk (from Legendary: X-Men).

'''Teleport''': See Dark City.

'''"Choose a Villain Group"''': Some Karnak cards say things like "Choose a Villain Groups. You get '''+1''' Attack for each Villain in your Victory Pile from that Group." For example, you can choose the Villain Group "Inhuman Rebellion."
* You can also count a Henchman Villain Group like "Doombot Legion." However, you can't choose the generic word "Henchmen" and count Villains from multiple Henchmen Groups at once.
* You also can't count two Villain Groups at once by choosing a word or phrase that appears in both Villain Groups. For example, if you choose the "Hydra" Villain Group, you can't also count "Hydra Elite" Villains. They are not the same Villain Group.
* You can't count cards that have no Villain Group, like Tactics, Bystanders, Master Strikes, Scheme Twists, or Heroes that were turned into Villains.
* Traps and Locatons from other from other sets aren't Villains, so they don't count, even if that Trap turned into a Villain.


=== Annihilation ===

'''Focus''': See Fantastic Four
* Super-Skrull uses the Fantastic Four's abilities with a twist, focusing Attack instead of Recruit.

'''Man and Woman Out of Time''': See Captain America 75th Anniversary
* You can use a Focus ability on a Man Out of Time card throughout the first and second turns you play the card.
* If a special ability lets you copy (or play a copy of) a Hero card, you can't use Man Out of Time on the copy.
* Some enemies send your cards Out of Time, setting them aside in the same way. When you play and discard that card at the start of your next turn, you can't use Man Out of Time again.

'''Momentum'''
The Annihilation Wave is a fast-moving invasion force. While pushing forward, they feed on the resources of new territory, becoming more powerful. This is represented by the new "Momentum" keyword.
* Some Villains say things like "Momentum 3." This means '''"This Villain gets +3 Attack if it entered another city space this turn."'''
* This works on the turn the Villain enters the city. It also works on any other turn when it is pushed into another city space by another Villain, or by a special ability moving or swapping it to another space.
* The Mastermind Annihilus has a variant "'''Mass Momentum 2.'''" This means '''he gets +2 Attack for each Villain currently in the city that entered a new city space this turn.''' (This doesn't include Villains who entered the Escape Pile this turn.)
* For both Momentum and Mass Momentum, it doesn't matter how many different city spaces a Villain entered during a turn. It only matters if it entered any new spaces at all.
* If a board gets complicated, with special abilities moving Villains around, some players like to shift Momentum Villains up a bit to help signal that they have entered a new space this turn.

'''Conqueror''': See Marvel Studios Phase 1 and Heroes of Asgard.


=== Messiah Complex ===

'''Clone Heroes''': Multiple Man and the Stepford Cuckoos are literal clones. M and her sisters can transform into copies of each other. Shatterstar is genetically engineered from cloned DNA. All of these use the new Clone keyword, saying things like “https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png: Clone”.
* This means: '''You may gain another copy of this card from the HQ. If there are none in the HQ, you may gain a copy from the Hero Deck and shuffle it.'''
* “Gain” means “put it into your discard pile.”
* If you a Clone a S.H.I.E.L.D. Officer or Sidekick, search and shuffle that stack instead.

'''“When Recruited” Clones''': Some Heroes say “When Recruited: Clone”. This means '''Use the Clone ability immediately when you recruit this Hero.''' (Do this right after you put the recruited Hero in your discard pile, after you refill its HQ space.)
* Use a “When Recruited” ability only when you recruit a Hero, not when an ability causes you to “gain” a Hero or “put it in your hand.” So the copy you gain from “When Recruited: Clone” '''won’t''' make you also gain a third copy, then a fourth copy, etc.
* Some Heroes say things like “When Recruited — https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png: Clone.” '''Use this ability only if you have played a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png Hero this turn before recruiting this card.'''

'''Clone Villains''': On a Villain, “Ambush: Clone” means: '''Search the Villain Deck for a copy of this Villain, and it enters the city, ignoring any further Clone effects. Shuffle that deck.''' When you Clone a “Predator X” Villain, just use the first “Predator X” you find in the Villain Deck. If you can’t find a Clone copy of a Villain (or Hero), just move on.

'''Shatter''': Rictor’s earthquake powers, Siryn’s sonic shrieks, and Shatterstar’s bioelectric shocks can Shatter even the strongest defenses. Some Heroes say things like “Shatter a Villain in the Sewers.”
* This means '''“Halve that enemy’s current Atttack. (round up to the nearest whole number.)”''' This effect lasts until the end of this turn.
* You can shatter the same Villain multiple times, halving their Attack (rounding up) each time.
* “Shatter a Villain” can’t be used on a Mastermind.
* “Shatter the Mastermind,” lasts for one fight against that Mastermind.
* A few cards even let you Shatter a Hero in the HQ, halving their current cost (round up) the same way.
* Technically, the Villain gets - Attack equal to half its current Attack. For example: Pestilence has 5 printed Attack. Apocalypse says “Four Horsemen Villains get +2 Attack.” Shattering gives her -3 Attack, from 7 Attack to 4 Attack.

'''Tactical Formation''': X-Force is known for precise strike force tactics. X-Factor Investigations likewise plans their missions to the finest detail. With this new keyword, some Heroes say things like “Tactical Formation 445: You get +3 Attack.”
* '''You can use this ability only if you have two Heroes that cost 4 and one Hero that costs 5.'''
* You can count the “Tactical Formation” card itself.
* “Heroes you have” includes Heroes you already played this turn and Heroes in your hand.

'''Investigate''': See Noir

'''Prey''': Some Villains say things like “Ambush: Prey on the fewest https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png.” After this Villain enters the Sewers, each player reveals their hand, and you check which player has the fewest https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26287_0.png cards. (The current player decides how to break ties, including ties of 0 https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26283_0.png cards.) '''Put this Villain in front of that player, “Preying” on them.'''
* Any player may still fight that Villain as normal. However: '''if no player defeats that Villain by the end of the preyed-on player’s turn, use that Villain’s “Finish the Prey” ability against that player, then that Villain enters the Sewers, ignoring its Ambush effects.
* Important: Do the “Finish the Prey” ability after that player draws their new hand at end of turn.''' Some players like to lean the Prey Villain on their deck as a reminder to Finish the Prey then.
* After Lady Deathstrike Finishes the Prey, or if you fight her while she’s Preying on a player, return her to the Mastermind space. You still take one of her Tactics if you fight her while she’s Preying.
* Multiple enemies can prey on a player at once.

'''Chivalrous Duel''': See Ant-Man

'''Veiled and Unveiled Schemes'''
The enemies of mutantkind often hide their true goals until it’s too late. All 4 Schemes in this set are “Veiled Schemes.” They say “Unveiled Scheme” on the reverse side. When you use any of these Scheme cards, start with the “Veiled Scheme” side face up. At a certain point, it will say “This Scheme Transforms into a random Unveiled Scheme.” This means you remove the Veiled Scheme from the game and replace it with a randomly selected “Unveiled Scheme” from all the ones you own. You might randomly select the reverse side of the Veiled Scheme you started with, or you might randomly select the Unveiled Scheme side of a different card.

=== Doctor Strange and the Shadows of Nightmare ===

'''Demonic Bargain''': Demons offer gifts of power with a dark price, hoping to corrupt the souls of mortals. These deals with the devil are especially corrupting to the powerful and arrogant. The humble are more likely to escape with their souls intact. This is represented with the new Demonic Bargain keyword.
* Some Villains like Satana Hellstrom say things like “Fight: Choose a player to make a Demonic Bargain with Satana Hellstrom to rescue three Bystanders.”
* '''That player discards the top card of their deck to see if they are corrupted by power. If that discarded card costs 1 or more, that player is too powerful and arrogant to resist temptation and gains a Wound, to the demon’s delight.'''
* If that discarded card costs 0, then that player has been humble enough to resist corruption.
* Whether that player gained a Wound or not, they then gain the Demonic Bargain’s listed benefit.
* Some cards have you choose which player must make a Bargain for a benefit. Think carefully about how many cards in your deck cost 0. If most of your deck is still 0-cost cards, it may be worthwhile to seize the power of the Demonic Bargain for yourself. But if your deck has lots of high-cost cards, then it may be wiser to choose another player to make the Demonic Bargain instead. Just beware: mortals who think they can outwit and outbargain a Demon are often left regretting their hubris.
* When you choose a player to make a Demonic Bargain, that player cannot decline.
* Dormammu forces players to make cruel, all-downside Demonic Bargains, with the chance of a Wound plus an additional negative effect.
* If you use card abilities to look at or manipulate the top card of your deck, you may gain valuable insight as to whether a Demonic Bargain will punish you.

'''Astral Plane''': The Fear Lords are cruel demons that move themselves and others beyond the physical world to a realm of pure psychic energy. There they prey on the human psyche, evoking nightmare and terror. This is represented with new “Astral Plane” abilities.
* Some Villains say things like “Fight: If this Villain was in the city, it enters the Astral Plane.”
* The Astral Plane is a single, unique space that only exists in games with cards that use the Astral Plane. It sits immediately to the right of the Villain Deck.
* While a Villain is in the Astral Plane, it has no physical form: '''it can only be fought with Recruit, not Attack.''' To fight a 5 Attack Villain you must spend 5 Recruit. When you fight a Villain in the Astral Plane, put it in your Victory Pile and do its Fight effect as normal.
* '''When a Villain enters the Astral Plane, any Villain already there escapes.''' This causes all the same effects as if that Villain had escaped the city (including KO’ing from the HQ, discarding from captured Bystanders, and Escape abilities).
* Villains still get -Attack and +Attack bonuses while in the Astral Plane. You just use Recruit to fight the total Attack.
* The Mastermind “Nightmare” can also enter the Astral Plane. While there, he can only be fought with Recruit, not Attack. If he escapes the Astral Plane, do all the normal effects for a Villain escaping the city. Then do the Escape ability written on Nightmare, which moves him to the Mastermind space.
* The Astral Plane is not a city space. It’s not “adjacent” to any city spaces. Card effects can’t move or swap Villains to or from the Astral Plane unless they explicitly mention the Astral Plane.
* Villains do Ambush effects when they enter the city. The Astral Plane is not part of the city, so Villains that enter the Astral Plane don’t do their Ambush effects at that time.
* For keywords from other sets: To fight a "Chivalrous Duel" enemy in the Astral Plane, you must spend Recruit from a single Hero name. You must spend Recruit to use Excessive Violence or Human Shields from the Astral Plane. You can't use "Piercing Energy" on enemies in the Astral Plane. "Bribe" and other cards that say "You can spend any combination of Recruit or Attack to fight that Villain this turn." do not work against enemies in the Astral Plane.

'''Artifacts''': See Guardians of the Galaxy and Heroes of Asgard

'''Ritual Artifacts''': Marvel’s sorcerers invoke Rituals of awesome power, anchored by mystic talismans. This is represented with a special type of Artifact appearing for the first time in this set: Ritual Artifacts. These follow all the normal Artifact rules above with some new twists.
* They say things like “Ritual Artifact — If you drew a card: You may discard this Artifact to get +3 Attack.”
* If you have fulfilled the listed Ritual condition this turn, you can discard the Ritual Artifact to get the listed effect.
* You don’t have to use the Ritual Artifact even if you fulfill the Ritual condition. You might want to save it for a future turn instead of discarding it to use now.
* You can use as many Ritual Artifacts as you wish in a turn, including using multiple Ritual Artifacts with the same name. If you draw one card, that’s enough to use the Rituals of multiple Artifacts that each have the condition “Draw a card.”
* If you use a “draw a card” ability, and it draws you a Ritual Artifact with the condition “draw a card,” then you can play that Artifact and use it right away. It’s ok that the Artifact wasn’t in play when you fulfilled the Ritual condition earlier in the turn.
* If a card lets you “copy” a Ritual Artifact card or “play a copy of it,” then you can use its Ritual effect (or "Thrown Artifact" or "Once per turn" Artifact ability) once, and you don't need to fulfill the ritual condition. You don’t need to immediately discard the copy card to use the Ritual. The copy doesn't stay in play as an Artifact.

=== Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy ===

'''Divided Cards''': See Civil War and X-Men

'''Artifacts''': See Guardians of the Galaxy

'''Triggered Artifacts''':
* Some cards say things like "Triggered Artifact - Whenever you draw a card during your turn, you get '''+1''' Attack." While you control this Artifact, '''every time you do that trigger, you get the listed effect.'''
* If a card lets you "copy" a Triggered Artifact card of "play a copy of it," then you can use that Triggered Artifact ability (or "Thrown Artifact," "Once per turn" Artifact or "Ritual Aritfact" ability) once, and you don't need to fulfill the trigger. The copy doesn't stay in play as an Artifact. The 'Legendry Outlaw' card from the 2014 Guardians set cannot copy any Artifacts in this set.

'''Villainous Weapons''': See Heroes of Asgard

'''Excessive Violence''': See Deadpool and Venom

'''Excessive Kindness''':
By contrast, the empath Mantis and the adorable Baby Groot are often way kinder than necessary. Their "Excessive Kindness" abilities work just like Excessive Violence, except that you trigger them by spending '''1''' Recruit more than you need when recruiting a Hero.

'''Command''':
Some Villains say things like "Taserface gets '''+2''' Attack while he Commands the Ravagers."
* '''A Villain "Commands" their group and gets these abilities as long as it's the leftmost Villain of that Villain Group in the city.'''
* If there's only one Villain of a Villain Group in the city, it still Commands that Villain Group.

=== Black Panther ===

'''Ambush Abilities on Heroes''':
Some Heroes say things like "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Ambush: Draw a card." This is similar to how a Villain does its Ambush ability when it enters the city.
* '''When a Hero with a "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Ambush" ability enters the HQ during your turn, you may use that Ambush ability if you have a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Hero.'''
* As always, you "have a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Hero" if you have played a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Hero this turn or if you have a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Hero in your hand (or if you control a https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_26284_0.png Hero Artifact).
* New Heroes usually enter the HQ when you recruit a Hero or a Villain escapes from the city, creating an empty space in the HQ that you refill.
* In games with Hero Ambush abilities, you may want to recruit before you fight, in case a new Hero entering the HQ gives you extra Attack or cards that you can use to fight stronger enemies.

'''Putting Wounds on Villains''':
* Some Hero cards say things like "Wound a Villain."
* To do this: '''Put a Wound onto a Villain from the Wound Stack or from the KO pile. A Villain gets -1 Attack for each Wound on it. When that Villain is defeated or leaves the city, return all Wounds on it to the Wound Stack.'''
* If a Villain has '''0''' Attack or negative Attack, they don't disappear automatically, but you can fight them during your turn by spending '''0''' Attack. (If you fight a Villain with negative Attack, you won't get a refund.)
* Some cards specifically say they Wound the Mastermind. This works the same way, with all of the Mastermind’s Wounds returning to the Wound Stack after a Mastermind Tactic is fought. The Wounds go away even if the Mastermind Tactic tells you to shuffle the Tactic back into the Mastermind’s other Tactics or put the Tactic somewhere else.
* Killmonger has '''5''' Attack and says "While Killmonger has more than '''0''' Attack, you cannot fight him. Instead, you may spend Attack equal to his Attack to Wound him and get +1 Recruit." So players will have to spend 5 Attack, then 4 Attack, 3 Attack, 2 Attack, and 1 Attack, getting 5 Recruit along the way. Then a player can fight him at 0 Attack to take a random Tactic, remove Killmonger's Wounds (and not get +1 Recruit). Malice and Preyy work similarly. You can Wound them this way multiple times per turn. This does not count as a "Fight," and you can still use the "Healing" ability on your own Wounds on the same turn that you Wound an enemy this way.
* If your Wound Stack contains different kinds of Wounds, like the Grievous Wounds from Legendary: Civil War, then whenever you return Wounds to the Wound Stack, put them on the bottom. Wounds on enemies are face up.
* If an effect causes "each player" to gain a Wound (or do anything else), start with the current player then go clockwise.
