This setup wizard will install an Rshiny app called Legendary Generator intended for use on your local computer. The app allows you to browse and view Marvel Legendary cards and generate game setups according to the rules with various optional restrictions.

This setup generator is compatible with a Tabletop Simulator mod to easily import setups there and run them: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2269377314

This app requires R4.2.0. to work. If this is not already installed on your local system, the installer will install it as well. 

If an older version of R is installed, this app will install the newer version. Please note that this may modify the version of R third party applications such as Rstudio point to, including any packages installed.
